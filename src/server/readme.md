## Testing
Tests cover all functionality except for server startup, templating and routing.<br/>
This project follows, for the most-part, the TDD design philosophy. Additions to the program should be accompanied by a test suite for the given use case. That is, as long as it is not to do with the cases listed above.<br/>
### Reason for not doing 100% TDD
I simply don't want to figure out how to do it at this time. In the next project, or perhaps upon finishing this one.
### Reason for no Fuzzing
I plan on doing this after the project is finished in preparation for the next project: Kissu-Search-and-Archive
